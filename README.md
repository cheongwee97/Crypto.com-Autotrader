# Crypto.com-Autotrader

## Introduction
This is a simple scipt in python that allows me to implement elementary trading strategies that I have backtested on the live market.

The backend codes are from https://exchange-docs.crypto.com/spot/index.html#introduction

## Steps

1.  Generate your own keys (https://exchange-docs.crypto.com/spot/index.html#generating-the-api-key) and update keys.json
2.  Update trade.py to set the coinName, coinCurrency and period
3.  Update cro.py obtainIndicators() to calculate and store the indicator values that you will require.
4.  Update trade.py trade() to fit your intended strategy
6.  Start trading! 


## Disclaimer
I am by no means an expert in the field! 
It is a small project for me to learn more about trading in the real market and the differences it has in comparison to a simulated backtrading environment.

## Closing remarks
My background is in Data Science and Machine Learning and I'm passionate about the assets trading market, especially crytocurrencies.
Any feedback and suggestions on tools or learning roadmaps to improve would be greatly appreciated.
